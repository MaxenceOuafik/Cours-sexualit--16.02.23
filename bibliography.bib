  abstract = {Background: Several outbreaks of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) were recently documented among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Europe. We investigated the HAV incidence among MSM in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and HAV seroprevalence and HAV vaccination decision among MSM visiting the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinic in Amsterdam. Methods: Using surveillance data from 1992 to 2017 of MSM with acute HAV in Amsterdam, we estimated the incidence by calendar year and age. We explored HAV seroprevalence by calendar year and age, determinants for HAV seropositivity, and opting-in/out for HAV vaccination using data collected among MSM that visited the STI clinic between 2006 and 2017 and were included in a nationwide Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programme. Offering HAV vaccination at the STI clinic differed over three consecutive periods: not offered, offered for free, or offered for 75 euros. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore determinants. Results: HAV incidence increased in 2016/17 after 4 years of absence and peaked in MSM around 35 years of age. Among MSM visiting the STI clinic, HAV seroprevalence was 37\% (95\%CI = 35–40\%), which was constant over the period 2006–2017, and increased with age (p {$<$} 0.001). Determinants for HAV seropositivity in multivariable analysis were: older age (p {$<$} 0.001), originating from an HAV endemic country (p {$<$} 0.001), and being HBV seropositive (p = 0.001). MSM opted-in more frequently when HAV vaccination was offered for free versus paid (89\% versus 11\%, respectively; p {$<$} 0.001). Younger MSM were less inclined to vaccinate when payment was required (p = 0.010). Post-hoc analyses showed that 98\% versus 46\% of MSM visiting the Amsterdam STI clinic would be protected against HAV infection if HAV vaccination was offered for free or for 75 euros, respectively. Conclusions: The MSM population of Amsterdam is vulnerable to a new HAV outbreak. We strongly recommend that MSM have access to free hepatitis A vaccination. Ó 2019 The Authors.

  abstract = {Studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-emtricitabine (FTC)–based preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have not focused on transgendered women who are at disproportionate risk of HIV acquisition. Concerns exist for drug interactions between cross-sex therapy (estradiol, progestins, and spironolactone) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–emtricitabine. This review assessed the experimental and theoretical risk for such drug interactions. It was found that none of these medications are implicated as major perpetrators of drug interactions, and the classes use different metabolic pathways for clearance, suggesting a low likelihood for interactions in either direction. Subanalyses of transgender women in Preexposure Prophylaxis Initiative suggested PrEP efficacy if adherence was high. Nevertheless, several research gaps were identified, particularly the need for controlled interaction studies in transgendered women, including effects on renal clearance, intracellular tenofovir diphosphate and emtricitabine triphosphate in target cells, as well as hormone effects on HIV susceptibility and immunity. PrEP should continue to be offered to transgender women while additional research is planned or pending.},

Predetermined inclusion criteria were selected. Thirty quantitative studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. Discriminative behaviors experienced by SGM individuals were stigma, denial or refusal of health care, and verbal or physical abuse. Knowledge and educational levels, beliefs, and religion of health care providers affected their attitudes toward SGM patients and their homophobia level. These findings revealed that health care providers needed more education about SGM issues, and SGM-friendly policies should be created for improving health care for SGM individuals.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Cross-sectional study of the FUNCFRAIL multicenter cohort. The setting was outpatient HIV-Clinic. OAWH, 50\,year or over were included. We recorded sociodemographic data, HIV infection-related data, comorbidity, frailty, geriatric syndromes (depression, cognitive impairment, falls and malnutrition), quality of life (QOL) and the estimated risk of all-cause 5-year mortality by VACS Index. Association of frailty with geriatric syndromes and comorbidity was evaluated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Seven hundred ninety six patients were included. 24.7\% were women, mean age was 58.2 (6.3). 14.7\% were 65 or over. 517 (65\%) patients had ≥3 comorbidities, ≥ 1 geriatric syndrome and/or frailty. There were significant dif‑ferences in the estimated risk of mortality [(frailty 10.8\%) vs. (≥ 3 comorbidities 8.2\%) vs. (≥ 1 geriatric syndrome 8.2\%) vs. (nothing 6.2\%); p =\,0.01] and in the prevalence of fair or poor QOL [(frailty 71.7\%) vs. (≥ 3 comorbidities 52\%) vs. (≥ 1 geriatric syndrome 58.4\%) vs. (nothing 51\%); p =\,0.01]. Cognitive impairment was significantly associated to mortal‑ity (8.7\% vs. 6.2\%; p =\,0.02) and depression to poor QOL [76.5\% vs. 50\%; p\,=\,0.01]. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Frailty, geriatric syndromes, and comorbidity had negative effects on mortality and QOL, but frailty had the greatest negative effect out of the three factors. Our results should be a wake-up call to standardize the screening for frailty and geriatric syndromes in OAWH in the clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has shown a significant increase in recent years. In Germany, this circumstance is reflected by a rise in the number of reported syphilis cases. There has also been an uptick in the incidence of non-notifiable STIs such as gonorrhea and infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A key factor in the spread of these infections is their varied clinical presentation, which includes urogenital, pharyngeal and rectal involvement as well as a large number of asymptomatic cases. New real-time multiplex PCR methods allow for rapid and targeted detection of STI pathogens. The most common bacterial STI is urogenital chlamydial infection caused by serovars D-K, which affects young adults in particular. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by L serovars often presents as chlamydial proctitis. In recent years, Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae has shown a significant development of resistance, with high-level monoresistance and multiresistance to antibiotics commonly used for treatment. It is therefore imperative that sensitivity testing of N. gonorrhoeae be performed in addition to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Increased drug resistance has also been observed for Mycoplasma genitalium, a fact that complicates treatment.},

It is important to ensure that screening has benefits that outweigh the risks of increased antibiotics resistance. We develop a mathematical model to estimate the effectiveness of screening on prevalence. Separable Temporal Exponential family Random Graph Models are used to model the sexual relationships network, both with main and casual partners. Next, the transmission of Gonorrhoea is simulated on this network. The models are implemented using the R package ‘statnet’, which we adapted among other things to incorporate infection status at the pharynx, urethra and rectum separately and to distinguish between anal sex, oral sex and rimming. The different screening programmes compared are no screening, 3.5\% of the population screened, 32\% screened and 50\% screened. The model simulates day-by-day evolution for 10 years of a population of 10 000. If half of the population would be screened, the prevalence in the pharynx decreases from 11.9\% to 10.2\%. We conclude that the limited impact of screening on NG prevalence may not outweigh the increased risk of antibiotic resistance.},

Findings  ~       In this systematic review, we identified 6 themes regarding the experiences and needs of transgender youths: experiencing pervasive stigma and discrimination in health care, feeling vulnerable and uncertain in decision-making, traversing risks to overcome systemic barriers to transitioning, internalizing intense fear of consequences, experiencing prejudice undermining help-seeking efforts, and experiencing strengthened gender identity and finding allies.    Meaning  ~       This review suggests that improving access to gender-affirming services with a cultural humility lens and addressing sociolegal stressors may promote engagement in care, minimize the use of unsafe interventions, and improve health outcomes in this population.    Importance  ~       Transgender and nonbinary youths have a higher incidence of a range of health conditions and may paradoxically face limited access to health care.    Objective  ~       To describe the perspectives and needs of transgender youths in accessing health care.    Evidence Review  ~       MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched from inception to January 2021. Qualitative studies of transgender youths' perspectives on accessing health care were selected. Results from primary studies were extracted. Data were analyzed using thematic synthesis.    Findings  ~       Ninety-one studies involving 884 participants aged 9 to 24 years across 17 countries were included. We identified 6 themes: experiencing pervasive stigma and discrimination in health care, feeling vulnerable and uncertain in decision-making, traversing risks to overcome systemic barriers to transitioning, internalizing intense fear of consequences, experiencing prejudice undermining help-seeking efforts, and experiencing strengthened gender identity and finding allies. Each theme encapsulated multiple subthemes.    Conclusions and Relevance  ~       This review found that transgender youths contend with feelings of gender incongruence, fear, and vulnerability in accessing health care, which are compounded by legal, economic, and social barriers. This can lead to disengagement from care and resorting to high-risk and unsafe interventions. Improving access to gender-affirming care services with a cultural humility lens and addressing sociolegal stressors may improve outcomes in transgender and nonbinary youths.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Gonorrhoea and chlamydia cases have been rising among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) over the last decade. The majority of cases are extragenital and occur at the oropharynx and anorectum. The aim of this narrative review was to review the risk factors and mode of transmission for gonorrhoea and chlamydia at the oropharynx and anorectum among MSM. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION New evidence suggests that oropharyngeal gonorrhoea can be transmitted by kissing in addition to through the established route of condomless oral sex; and anorectal gonorrhoea can be acquired when saliva is used as a lubricant for anal sex and rimming in addition to the established route of condomless penile-anal sex in MSM. In contrast, condomless penile-anal sex remains the major route for chlamydia transmission. CONCLUSIONS Substantial transmission of gonorrhoea may occur with practices other than the established routes of condomless oral and/or anal sex and hence condoms may not be effective in preventing gonorrhoea transmission to extragenital sites. In contrast, condoms are effective for chlamydia control because it is mainly transmitted through condomless penile-anal sex. Novel interventions for gonorrhoea that reduce the risk of transmission at extragenital site are required.},

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the research literature from 2000 to 2020 on the effectiveness of teaching medical students and residents on knowledge, attitudes, and skills in addressing the health of SGM persons and the strength of the research sample, design, and methods used. Results: We identified a total of 36 articles that assessed the impact of medical student and resident education on knowledge, comfort, attitudes, confidence, and skills in working with SGM patients. All studies utilized quasiexperimental designs, and found efficacious results. No study examined the impact of training on patient outcomes. Conclusion: Future studies will need to be powered and designed to assess the impact of training on patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Transgender individuals represent 0.55\% of the US population, equivalent to 1.4 million transgender adults. In transgender women, feminisation can include a number of medical and surgical interventions. The main goal is to deprive the phenotypically masculine body of androgens and simultaneously provide oestrogen therapy for feminisation. In gender-confirming surgery (GCS) for transgender females, the prostate is usually not removed. Due to limitations of existing cohort studies, the true incidence of prostate cancer in transgender females is unknown but is thought to be less than the incidence among cis-gender males. It is unclear how prostate cancer develops in androgen-deprived conditions in these patients. Six out of eleven case reports in the literature presented with metastatic disease. It is thought that androgen receptor-mediated mechanisms or tumour-promoting effects of oestrogen may be responsible. Due to the low incidence of prostate cancer identified in transgender women, there is little evidence to drive specific screening recommendations in this patient subpopulation. The treatment of early and locally advanced prostate cancer in these patients warrants an individualised thoughtful approach with input from patients' reconstructive surgeons. Both surgical and radiation treatment for prostate cancer in these patients can profoundly impact the patient's quality of life. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding screening and treatment of prostate cancer in transgender women and consider the current gaps in our knowledge in providing evidence-based guidance at the molecular, genomic and epidemiological level, for clinical decision-making in the management of these patients.},

  abstract = {Despite rises in sexually transmitted infection (STI) notifications among Australian women in the last decade, limited STI surveillance data exist specifically for women who have sex with women. This study aimed to compare differences in sexual practices and positivity for STIs and other genital infections among women who have sex with men only (WSMO), women who have sex with women only (WSWO), and women who have sex with men and women (WSMW), and whether these changed over time. In this retrospective repeated cross-sectional study, women attending the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre for the first time between 2011 and 2019 were categorized as “WSMW,” “WSWO,” or “WSMO” according to self-reported sexual practices in the previous 12 months. Demographic information, sexual practices, and positivity for STIs and other genital infections were compared between the three groups and over time. A total of 36,147 women (2618 WSMW, 534 WSWO, and 32,995 WSMO) were included. WSMW reported more sexual partners (median\,=\,6; IQR\,=\,4–10) than WSMO (median\,=\,3; IQR\,=\,2–5) and WSWO (median\,=\,2; IQR\,=\,1–4) (p\,{$<$}\,.001). A higher proportion of WSMW always used condoms with casual male partners compared to WSMO (20.4\% vs 15.9\%; p\,{$<$}\,.001). The proportion of women who always used condoms with casual male partners decreased over time in WSMO, (19.9\% in 2011 to 15.2\% in 2019, ptrend\,{$<$}\,.001) but not in WSMW. Bacterial vaginosis was more common in WSWO (14.8\%) than in WSMW (11.8\%) and WSMO (7.7\%) (p\,{$<$}\,.001). Chlamydia was more common in WSMO (9.3\%) than in WSMW (6.6\%) and WSWO (1.2\%) (p\,{$<$}\,.001). Syphilis was more common in WSMO (1.0\%) than in WSMW (0.3\%) and WSWO (0.0\%) (p\,=\,.004). Over time, chlamydia positivity in WSWO increased (from 0.0\% to 2.7\%, ptrend\,=\,.014), and syphilis positivity in WSMW increased (from 0.0\% to 0.7\%, ptrend\,=\,.028); however, positivity of these STIs did not change in other groups. Sexual practices and positivity for STIs and other genital infections differed according to the sex of women’s partners in the previous 12 months. Knowledge of these differences is important to account for future changes in STI trends that may occur in these subpopulations.},

Frailty is an age-related syndrome of increased vulnerability to stress, predictive of major adverse clinical outcomes among HIV-infected and uninfected persons alike. Understanding frailty pathogenesis is critical to developing interventions to improve health outcomes in HIV.

The outcomes included anogenital precancers/cancers, head and neck cancers, genital warts, and RRP recurrence. From the 2216 records identified, 30 studies (25 effectiveness and 5 impact studies) were included in this systematic literature review. The results, quantity, and quality of these studies were highly variable. The evidence for effectiveness was of high quality only in women with prior/current cervical disease and in individuals with RRP, the most frequently studied populations. No studies of transgender/non-binary individuals or female sex workers were identified. The real-world evidence supports HPV vaccination among women with prior cervical disease and individuals with RRP. Significant real-world data gaps remain in these high-risk populations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Concerns over potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) between feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have hampered uptake and adherence of PrEP among transgender women (TGW). To determine DDI between FHT and PrEP, we measured the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of blood plasma estradiol (E2) and tenofovir (TFV) in Thai TGW. METHODS: Twenty TGW who never underwent orchiectomy and had not received injectable FHT within six months were enrolled between January and March 2018. FHT (E2 valerate and cyproterone acetate) were prescribed to participants at baseline until week 5, and then from week 8 until the end of study. Daily PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) was initiated at week 3 and continued without interruption. Intensive E2 PK parameters and testosterone concentration at 24~hours (C24 ) were measured at weeks 3 (without PrEP) and 5 (with PrEP), and intensive TFV PK parameters were measured at weeks 5 (with FHT) and 8 (without FHT). RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) age, body mass index, and creatinine clearance were 21.5 (21-26) years, 20.6 (19.0-22.4) kg/m2 , and 116 (101-126.5) mL/min, respectively. The geometric mean (\%CV) of area under curve from time zero to 24~hours (AUC0-24 ), maximum concentration (Cmax ), and C24 of E2 at weeks 3 and 5 were 775.13 (26.2) pg~h/mL, 51.47 (26.9) pg/mL, and 15.15 (42.0) pg/mL; and 782.84 (39.6), 55.76 (32.9), and 14.32 (67.4), respectively. The geometric mean (\%CV) of TFV AUC0-24 , Cmax , and C24 at weeks 5 and 8 were 2242.1 (26.5) ng~h/mL, 353.9 (34.0) ng/mL, and 40.9 (31.4) ng/mL; and 2530.2 (31.3), 311.4 (30.0), and 49.8 (29.6), respectively. The geometric mean of TFV AUC0-24 and C24 at week 5 were significantly less than that at week 8 by 12\% (p~=~0.03) and 18\% (p~{$<~$}0.001), respectively. There were no significant changes in E2 PK parameters and median C24 of bioavailable testosterone between week 3 and week 5. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated lower blood plasma TFV exposure in the presence of FHT, suggesting that FHT may potentially affect PrEP efficacy among TGW; but E2 exposure was not affected by PrEP. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these reductions in TFV are clinically significant. Clinical Trial Number: NCT03620734.},

First isolated in 1981, M genitalium is the smallest known self replicating bacterium,2 but its natural course of infection and importance for public health remain poorly understood. Most infections are probably asymptomatic and have no adverse health outcomes.34 Nonetheless, evidence that M genitalium is associated with serious genitourinary and reproductive health morbidity is accumulating. In men, an unequivocal association exists with non-gonococcal urethritis, and it is detected in up to 40\% of men with persistent and recurrent urethritis.5 There is some evidence of associations with balanoposthitis6 but no clear association with prostatitis or epididymitis.78 A study among men who have sex …},

Evidence points to blood exposure during sex as the medium of hepatitis C virus transmission. Hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM overall and in relation to injection drug use is poorly characterized. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis examining global hepatitis C virus antibody prevalence and estimating active hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM were conducted; 42 reports provided anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence data among HIV + MSM. Pooled prevalence produced an overall anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM of 8.1\%; active HCV prevalence estimate was 5.3\%-7.3\%. Anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among injection drug use and non-injection drug use HIV + MSM was 40.0\% and 6.7\%, respectively. Among HIV + MSM, hepatitis C virus prevalence increased significantly over time among the overall and non-injection drug use groups, and decreased significantly among injection drug use HIV + MSM. We identified a moderate prevalence of hepatitis C virus among all HIV + MSM and among non-injection drug use HIV + MSM; for both, prevalence was observed to be increasing slightly. Pooled prevalence of hepatitis C virus among HIV + MSM was higher than that observed in the 1945-1965 US birth cohort. The modest but rising hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM suggests an opportunity to control HCV among HIV + MSM; this combined with data demonstrating a rising hepatitis C virus incidence highlights the temporal urgency to do so.},

While research indicates the benefits of providing gender affirming hormone therapy through interdisciplinary primary care-based models, less is known about how service users and providers construct their understandings of affirmative approaches. In this paper, we present findings from a discourse analysis of four service users’ and four healthcare professionals’ talk about a primary care-based pilot clinic providing gender affirming hormone therapy in Aotearoa New Zealand. Participants employed notions of pathologisation, time, and agency in their talk to construct the clinic as a personal setting which gave service users time to make their own health decisions, while constructing hospitals as impersonal with lengthy wait times. The assessment-driven nature of best practice guidelines that governed clinicians’ decision-making was constructed as constraining users’ agency. Findings highlight the ongoing importance of aligning gender affirming hormone therapy with other non-disease types of healthcare, and suggest new ways for achieving this through affirmative approaches to healthcare.},

Women who have sex with women may be at disproportionate risk of obesity, tobacco use, substance use, mental health issues, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and some cancers. Disparities can exist throughout the lifetime. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents are vulnerable to bullying, family rejection, and risky sexual behavior that may lead to sexually transmitted infections or unintended pregnancy. Sexual minority stress, which is a response to stigmatization, prejudice, and internalized homophobia, contributes to many of these conditions. Family physicians should foster trust and communication to provide a nonjudgmental, welcoming environment supportive of culturally competent health care and optimal outcomes.

In 2019, we systematically reviewed the literature published in databases (Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science) from January 2000 to April 2019. Secondly, we conducted a cross-sectional global expert survey. To complete the evidence on the question of (de-)centralized delivery of transgender health care, we performed a grey literature search for additional information than the systematic review and the expert survey revealed. These analyses were conducted in 2020.ResultsEleven articles met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. 125 participants from 39 countries took part in the expert survey. With insights from the grey literature search, we found transgender health care in Europe was primarily delivered centralized. In most other countries, both centralized and decentralized delivery structures were present. Comprehensive care with medical standards and individual access to care were central topics associated with the different health care delivery settings.DiscussionThe setting in which transgender health care is delivered differs between countries and health systems and could influence different aspects of transgender health care quality. Consequently, it should gain significant attention in clinical practice and future health care research.},

  abstract = {A lack of access to knowledgeable providers is the greatest reported barrier to care for transgender individuals. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the recent literature characterizing transgender medicine education for medical providers and to summarize effective interventions for improving education in transgender care. The PubMed database was searched for all literature that assessed transgender medical education among physicians or trainees and all papers that reported results of transgender-specific educational interventions. Literature that only evaluated general lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) educational interventions was excluded. The lack of education in transgender care continues among providers across all levels of medical education from medical students and physician trainees to primary care providers, endocrinologists and other specialists involved in transgender care. Several interventions have been shown to effectively improve transgender knowledge and cultural competency. Education among healthcare providers is deficient and is considered a major barrier to care for transgender individuals. Effective interventions should be applied to fundamental medical education. Additional focused education also should be taught with specialty-appropriate content to produce needed proficiency among providers of transgender care.},

Gender-affirming medical care for transmasculine individuals can include testosterone therapy, which suppresses circulating estrogen and can lead to changes in the vaginal epithelium that are reminiscent of the post-menopausal period in cisgender females. Among transfeminine individuals, gender-affirming medical care can include vaginoplasty, which is the surgical creation of a vulva and neovaginal canal, commonly using penile and scrotal skin. The effect of gender-affirming medical care on the vagina of transmasculine individuals and on the neovagina of transfeminine individuals is poorly characterized. This review summarizes what is known of the epithelium and local microbiota of the testosterone-exposed vagina and the neovagina. We focus on potential pathogens and determinants of gynecological health and identify key knowledge gaps for future research.},

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of and the risk for sexually transmissible infections (STIs) for women engaging in same-sex sexual behaviour was investigated among women attending an STI clinic. Methods: Data from electronic medical records were reviewed and logistic regression used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of STIs. Women reporting life-time exclusively female partners (WSW) and women reporting female and male partners (WSWM) were compared with women reporting exclusively male partners (WSM). Outcomes included: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Neisseria gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis. Results: The study population comprised 103 564 women (WSW 641, WSWM 12 010 and WSM 90 913). Overall prevalence of STIs was 8\%. Crude OR of STIs for WSW: 0.56 (95\% CI 0.39–0.81), for WSWM: 0.99 (95\% CI 0.92–1.06) compared with WSM. Multivariate analysis revealed an interaction effect between same-sex sexual behaviour and smoking. Among non-smokers; WSW adjusted OR was 0.41 (95\% CI 0.21–0.80), WSWM adjusted OR was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.81–1.02) compared with WSM. Among smokers; WSW adjusted OR was 1.03 (95\% CI 0.63–1.67) for WSWM adjusted OR was 1.00 (CI 95\% 0.93–1.13), compared with WSM. Conclusion: This study, including the largest cohort of women reporting life-time exclusively female partners in an STI study, shows that WSW generally are at lower risk for acquiring STIs than WSM. Smoking WSW, however, had the same risk for acquiring bacterial STIs as WSM and WSWM. Our study suggests that all WSW should receive the same encouragement to test for STIs as WSM.},

Method: A scoping review on sexual health on WSW was conducted from 2000 to 2019. Papers with lack of focus on sexual health on WSW were excluded and a web tool was used to guarantee blindness. Information was extracted on the key characteristics of the studies and the quality of the evidence. The sexual health categories were comprehensive sexual health, specification of sexual practices in WSW, and recommendations provided. Results: 39 studies were included, mostly cross-sectional. The gaps identified were the lack of evidence on sexual health, confusion about sexual orientation and sexual practices, lack of specific interest in comprehensive sexual health and the life cycle approach. Recommendations focused on WSW selfcare; interventions aimed at clinical practice, research, education and prevention; and contributions of a feminist approach on sexual health of WSW. Conclusions: There are several gaps about in the knowledge about sexual health among WSW. Self-care improvement and specific strategies addressed to the unique characteristics of these women and their different and specific situation and health determinants are highlighted.},

Methods: National surveillance of hepatitis A, including reference laboratory confirmation and molecular sequencing, and a case questionnaire, was enhanced in 2017 to collect demographic and risk information, disease severity and healthcare utilisation. National Health Service (NHS) data was used to calculate associated healthcare costs. Results: During the outbreak period (July 2016 to January 2018), 670 confirmed cases were identified in England, caused by three distinct viral strains. The public health response included raising public and professional awareness, reinforcing vaccine recommendations for MSM, contact tracing for postexposure vaccination, and mass community vaccination where spill-over of infection into the general population occurred. Hepatitis A vaccine was centrally procured to ensure sexual health clinics in England could offer vaccination to MSM. Outbreak associated healthcare costs were estimated to be approximately £1,500,000. Conclusions: While MSM are at increased risk of hepatitis A infection, inconsistent implementation of MSM vaccination policy in previous years led to an increasingly susceptible MSM population. The large number of cases, hospital admission rate and public health actions contributed to a significant healthcare burden. Recommending hepatitis A vaccination for MSM and clarifying commissioning responsibilities is essential to prevent future outbreaks.},

PLWH underwent from suffering severe disease and often fatal complications at young ages to having a chronic condition and a life expectancy close to the general population. Nevertheless, chronic agerelated diseases increase as PLWH age. The harmful effect of HIV infection on the individual’s immune system adds to its deterioration during ageing, exacerbating comorbidities. In addition, PLWH are more exposed to risk factors affecting ageing, such as coinfections or harmful lifestyles. The ART initiation reverses the biological ageing process but only partially, and additionally can have some toxicities that influence ageing. Observational studies suggest premature ageing in PLWH. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the early prediction of unhealthy ageing through validated biomarkers, easy to implement in HIV-clinical settings. The most promising biomarkers are second-generation epigenetic clocks and integrative algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background: Members of the transgender community have identified healthcare access barriers, yet a corresponding inquiry into healthcare provider perspectives has lagged. Our aim was to examine physician perceptions of barriers to healthcare provision for transgender patients. Methods: This was a qualitative study with physician participants from Ontario, Canada. Semi-structured interviews were used to capture a progression of ideas related to barriers faced by physicians when caring for trans patients. Qualitative data were then transcribed verbatim and analysed with an emergent grounded theory approach. Results: A total of thirteen (13) physician participants were interviewed. Analysis revealed healthcare barriers that grouped into five themes: Accessing resources, medical knowledge deficits, ethics of transition-related medical care, diagnosing vs. pathologising trans patients, and health system determinants. A centralising theme of “not knowing where to go or who to talk to” was also identified. Conclusions: The findings of this study show that physicians perceive barriers to the care of trans patients, and that these barriers are multifactorial. Access barriers impede physicians when referring patients to specialists or searching for reliable treatment information. Clinical management of trans patients is complicated by a lack of knowledge, and by ethical considerations regarding treatments—which can be unfamiliar or challenging to physicians. The disciplinary division of responsibilities within medicine further complicates care; few practitioners identify trans healthcare as an interest area, and there is a tendency to overemphasise trans status in mental health evaluations. Failure to recognise and accommodate trans patients within sex-segregated healthcare systems leads to deficient health policy. The findings of this study suggest potential solutions to trans healthcare barriers at the informational level—with increased awareness of clinical guidelines and by including trans health issues in medical education—and at the institutional level, with support for both trans-focused and trans-friendly primary care models.},

A search strategy for lesbian, STI and bacterial vaginosis was applied to PubMed, LILACS and BDENF databases. Of 387 unique references retrieved, 22 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (cross-sectional studies reporting prevalence for 8 STIs/bacterial vaginosis and history of a STI). The most frequent infection reported was bacterial vaginosis, and none study reported data on hepatitis B. A wide range of prevalence was observed for most infections. In terms of risk factors, the number of sexual partners, the past or current smoking, a history of forced sex and sexual stigma seem to increase the risk of STI and bacterial vaginosis. The findings of this review are discussed considering guidelines directly addressing the LGBT community’s health and relevant studies investigating both safe sexual practices and the intricate relationship between LGBT people and their care providers. A set of recommendations to improve preventive care for lesbian women is proposed. Affirming that little is known about the extent of STIs and bacterial vaginosis transmission in female-to-female sexual activities or about the risk factors for STI and bacterial vaginosis among lesbian women is reasonable. In fact, the overall quality of the studies was low or very low with significant uncertainty around their findings. However, we consider that the available knowledge indicates some paths to be followed by care providers and policy decision-makers to improve their actions towards better sexual health of lesbian women.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have made it possible for persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to live a near expected life span, without progressing to AIDS or transmitting HIV to sexual partners or infants. There is, therefore, increasing emphasis on maintaining health throughout the life span. To receive optimal medical care and achieve desired outcomes, persons with HIV must be consistently engaged in care and able to access uninterrupted treatment, including ART. Comprehensive evidence-based HIV primary care guidance is, therefore, more important than ever. Creating a patient-centered, stigma-free care environment is essential for care engagement. Barriers to care must be decreased at the societal, health system, clinic, and individual levels. As the population ages and noncommunicable diseases arise, providing comprehensive healthcare for persons with HIV becomes increasingly complex, including management of multiple comorbidities and the associated challenges of polypharmacy, while not neglecting HIV-related health concerns. Clinicians must address issues specific to persons of childbearing potential, including care during preconception and pregnancy, and to children, adolescents, and transgender and gender-diverse individuals. This guidance from an expert panel of the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America updates previous 2013 primary care guidelines.},

  abstract = {Background. In 2018, the municipal Sexual Health Clinic in Seattle, implemented trans-inclusive questions about sexual behavior, anatomy, gender-affirming surgeries, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms in the clinic’s computerassisted self-interview (CASI) to improve care for transgender and nonbinary (TNB) patients. Methods. We calculated test positivity, the proportion of TNB patient visits that received testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); syphilis; pharyngeal, rectal, and urogenital gonorrhea (GC); and chlamydia (CT) before (5/2016–12/2018) and after (12/2018–2/2020) implementation of new CASI questions, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients who received anatomic site–specific screening based on reported exposures. Results. There were 434 TNB patients with 489 and 337 clinic visits during each period, respectively. Nonbinary patients assigned male at birth (AMAB) had the highest prevalence of GC (10\% pharyngeal, 14\% rectal, 12\% urogenital). Transgender women, transgender men, and nonbinary people AMAB had a high prevalence of rectal CT (10\%, 9\%, and 13\%, respectively) and syphilis (9\%, 5\%, and 8\%). Asymptomatic transgender women, transgender men, and nonbinary patients AMAB were more likely to receive extragenital GC/CT screening compared with nonbinary patients assigned female at birth. After implementation of trans-inclusive questions, there was a 33\% increase in the number of annual TNB patient visits but no statistically significant increase in HIV/STI testing among TNB patients. Conclusions. TNB people had a high prevalence of extragenital STIs and syphilis. Implementation of trans-inclusive medical history questions at a clinic that serves cisgender and transgender patients was feasible and important for improving the quality of affirming and inclusive sexual healthcare.},

  abstract = {Background Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) could become untreatable in the near future. Indeed, while the treatment of symptomatic gonorrhea in core groups, such men who have sex with men (MSM), is crucial for gonorrhea control programs, screening for and treating asymptomatic gonorrhea/Chlamydia trachomatis(chlamydia) in MSM may contribute to antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea. In this systematic review, we aim to assess if there is evidence that screening MSM for gonorrhea/chlamydia is associated with a decline in the prevalence of these infections. Methods We conducted a systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science for relevant studies including uncontrolled observational studies and reported the results following the PRISMA guidelines. The change in estimated prevalences for chlamydia and gonorrhea across the different time points for 3 anatomical sites (oral, urethral and anal) were collected and examined. Results Twelve studies met our entry criteria. We were able to statistically assess the change in prevalence in 10 of 12 studies. In 3 studies, there was a significant increase in chlamydia prevalence, whereas for gonorrhea, 2 studies reported a significant increase and 2 others a decrease. Our review provides little evidence that screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in MSM has an effect on the prevalence of these infections. No evidence was found that more frequent screening reduces prevalence more effectively than annual screening. Conclusions Our study was not able to provide evidence that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea lowers the prevalence of these infections in MSM. Randomized controlled trials are required to assess the risks and benefits of gonorrhea/chlamydia screening in high- and low-risk MSM.},

We reviewed the literature and interviewed nine key informants representing healthcare and service providers, researchers, and transgender advocates. Healthcare providers who care for transgender patients often demonstrate a lack of transgender competent care strategies. In addition, transgender people face many barriers to accessing HIV services. Although communication materials cannot address many of these barriers, materials specifically developed for transgender people and their healthcare providers would fill a gap and may increase uptake of HIV services. Materials for transgender people should include gender-affirming messaging and imagery, be framed in terms of resiliency, and present HIV information tailored to the needs of transgender people. Materials for healthcare providers should provide basic information to increase transgender competency and provision of comprehensive healthcare for transgender patients, inclusive of gender-affirming and HIV prevention, testing and care services.

The results revealed an overall high level of clustering despite the short time frame of sampling, with 47.6\% of all patients having at least one close genetic counterpart and 36.6\% belonging to a cluster of 3 or more individuals. Compared to patients on isolated branches, patients in clusters more frequently reported being infected in Belgium (95.1\% vs. 47.6\%; p {$<$} 0.001), were more frequently men having sex with men (MSM) (77.9\% vs. 42.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001), of Belgian origin (68.2\% vs. 32.9\%; p {$<$} 0.001), male gender (92.6\% vs. 65.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001), infected with subtype B or F (87.8\% vs. 43.4\%; p {$<$} 0.001) and diagnosed early after infection (55.4\% vs. 29.0\%; p {$<$} 0.001). Strikingly, Sub-Saharan Africans (SSA), overall representing 27.1\% of the population were significantly less frequently found in clusters than on individual branches (6.0\% vs. 41.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001). Of the SSA that participated in clustered transmission, 66.7\% were MSM and this contrasts sharply with the overall 12.0\% of SSA reporting MSM. Transmission clusters with SSA were more frequently non-B clusters than transmission clusters without SSA (44.4\% versus 18.2\%). MSM-driven clusters with patients of mixed origin may account, at least in part, for the increasing spread of non-B subtypes to the native MSM population, a cross-over that has been particularly successful for subtype F and CRF02\_AG. The main conclusions from this study are that clustered transmission in Belgium remains almost exclusively MSM-driven with very limited contribution of SSA. There were no indications for local ongoing clustered transmission of HIV-1 among SSA.},

We describe a series of 9 MtF transgender patients who underwent prostate tissue sampling and highlight histopathologic features and challenges related to pathologic interpretation of prostate tissue in this patient population. Seven of 9 total patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and all had elevated prostate-specific antigen at the time of diagnosis. Three of the 7 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had received different types of   hormone therapy   for gender affirmation before the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and in all 3 of these patients, there was histologic evidence of   hormone therapy   effect in both benign prostate tissue and/or the adenocarcinoma. The 2 patients with benign prostate tissue underwent transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms and were previously on   hormone therapy   for gender affirmation. Both of these specimens showed diffuse glandular atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia, indicative of   hormone therapy   effect on benign prostatic tissue. In the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, a spectrum of grades was observed, ranging from Grade Group 1 to Grade Group 5. Four patients underwent radical prostatectomy, with 2 cases showing extraprostatic extension and Grade Group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma, and 2 showing Grade Group 2 prostatic adenocarcinoma. Three of the 4 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had received gender-affirming   hormone therapy   before surgery, and all 3 of these specimens showed   hormone therapy   effect in non-neoplastic prostate tissue and focal   hormone therapy   effect in prostatic adenocarcinoma. The presence of areas of viable carcinoma without   hormone therapy   effect enabled the assignment of a Gleason score and Grade Group in these 3 cases.   Hormone therapy   administered for gender identity affirmation induces histopathologic changes to both benign prostate tissue (nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia, diffuse atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, and stromal dominance with decreased numbers of glands) and prostatic adenocarcinoma (nuclear pyknosis, atrophy, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and architectural patterns that would qualify for Gleason 4 and 5 in the absence of   hormone therapy   effect) that have been traditionally seen in cis-male prostate cancer patients receiving   hormone therapy  . In the absence of   hormone therapy  , the morphology of prostatic adenocarcinoma in transgender patients shows classic morphologic features similar to those seen in cis-male patients not on   hormone therapy  . Prostate cancer with   hormone therapy   effect may not only be histologically quite subtle and may be overlooked if not suspected, but also should not be assigned a Gleason score because the Gleason score would substantially overstate its biologic potential. Therefore, similar to cis-male patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, transgender patients on   hormone therapy   for gender affirmation may be at risk for both underrecognition and over-grading of prostate cancer, particularly if the pathologist is not aware of the clinical history.},

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated people with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), in relation to persistent systemic immune activation and metabolic dysregulation. The purpose of this review is to examine parameters which may affect CVD risk among transgender PWH.        Recent Findings    Among transgender women and men, prospective longitudinal studies have shown that gender-affirming hormonal therapy (GAHT) is associated with select deleterious cardiometabolic effects such as increases in visceral adipose tissue. Retrospective studies among transgender women and men suggest an increase in CVD risk, such as venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accidents, and myocardial infarction. Studies among transgender PWH adhering to GAHT and ART suggest heightened systemic immune activation/inflammation.        Summary    Prospective longitudinal studies assessing factors associated with increased CVD events among transgender PWH are needed to guide the development of CVD prevention strategies in this at-risk population.},
